## Backstory

Riles once quizzed me on pop figures.  I knew nothing.

So, Riles began posting news headlines into all chat during our Dota 2 games.

Then, he started replacing celebrity's names with mine.

That meant war, and here we are.  I saw a possibility to automate the process such that Riles has been unable to keep up with the memes.

## Quickstart:

Edit the config.properties file to add your own url and data files.  Some data files are found in the target/classes/data directory, the ones read at startup are in src/main/java/resources/data.


## How to deploy:

1. Create a new project
2. Git clone this into that new project directory
3. Do the stuff for the pom.xml (mvn install????) to get the dependencies.
4. /\/\e/\/\e
